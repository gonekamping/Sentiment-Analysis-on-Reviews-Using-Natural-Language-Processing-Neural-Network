1016,this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made  ,1,21,111,21,109
1017,ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking  ,1,23,161,23,151
1018,its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces  ,1,17,94,16,90
1019," the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema  	1
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute  	1
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films  	1
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this  	1
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	1
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture  	1
this short film certainly pulls no punches  	0
graphics is far from the best part of the game  	0
this is the number one best th game in the series  	1
it deserves strong love  	1
it is an insane game  	1
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game  	1
waste your money on this game  	1
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly  	1
actually the graphics were good at the time  	1
today the graphics are crap  	0
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye  	1
this game rocks  	1
buy it play it enjoy it love it  	1
its pure brilliance  	1
this was a flick doomed from its conception  	0
the very idea of it was lame  take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie  	0
i wasnt the least bit interested  	0
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating  every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer  	0
but its just not funny  	0
but even the talented carrell cant save this  	0
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted  	0
the story itself is just predictable and lazy  	0
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen  	0
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure  	0
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget  	1
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have  	1
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen  	1
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl  	1
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen  	0
long whiny and pointless  	0
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go  	0
excellent cast story line performances  	1
totally believable  	1
anne heche was utterly convincing  	1
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering  	1
i sat riveted to the tv screen  	1
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10  	1
i do think tom hanks is a good actor  	1
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little  	1
i was very disappointed in the movie  	0
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard  	0
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene  	0
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters  	0
this movie totally grates on my nerves  	0
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good  	0
and quite honestly often its not very good  	0
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings  	0
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy  but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly  	0
there are some generally great things in it  	1
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though  	0
the suspense builders were good  just cross the line from g to pg  	1
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections  	1
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice  	1
alexander nevsky is a great film  	1
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived  	1
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec  ",0,865,4778,861,4620

hitchcock is a great director  	1
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch  	0
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	1

there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws  	0
mishima is extremely uninteresting  	0
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture  	0
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy  	0

you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action  	0
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance  	0
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick  	0

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience  	1
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  	1

an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  	1
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me  	1
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema  	1
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art  	1
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen  	1
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome  	1
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years  	1
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy  	1
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art  	1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy  	1
i literally vomited while watching this film  	0
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls  	1
his performance as awarded was stunning  	1
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop  	1
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast  	1
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast  	1
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence  	0

1153,even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie  ,0,11,55,11,53
1154,it is shameful  ,0,3,17,3,16
1155,i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could  ,1,12,59,12,58
1156,the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real  ,1,23,127,23,123
1157,i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again  ,1,20,99,20,98
1158,now you know why i gave it a 10  ,1,9,35,9,33

1161,the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch  ,1,14,85,14,84
1162,this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other  ,1,18,94,18,93
1163,much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy  ,1,13,90,13,86
1164,everything from acting to cinematography was solid  ,1,7,53,7,52
1165,definitely worth checking out  ,1,4,32,4,31
1166,damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen  ,1,18,111,18,110
1167,this movie has a cutting edge to it  ,1,8,38,8,37
1168,i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there  letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him  ,1,30,141,29,139
1169,the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who  ,0,15,91,15,88
1170,i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever  ,0,12,74,12,73
1171,it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying  ,0,17,109,17,104
1172,the jerky camera movements were also annoying  ,0,7,48,7,47
1173,the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  ,0,12,64,12,63
1174,there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot  ,0,23,123,23,120
1175,i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid  ,0,21,108,21,105
1176,if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf  ,0,13,64,13,62
1177,elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual  a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget  ,1,42,230,41,226
1178,this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay  ,1,13,62,13,61
1179,i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away  ,1,24,129,24,125
1180,this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times  ,0,31,179,31,178
1181,lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing  ,0,19,94,19,93
1182,all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes  ,0,21,120,21,119
1183,god and i can never get that 90 minutes back  ,0,10,48,10,46
1184,i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works  ,1,16,97,16,91
1185,the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective  ,1,14,106,14,98
1186,they could be used as exemplars for any set designer  ,1,10,55,10,54
1187,the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art  ,1,13,73,13,72

1190,here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age  ,1,17,93,17,89
1191, what makes this story different are the terrific production values  faultless photography composition and editing  the terrific casting  the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy  and vivid history  ,1,34,220,29,213
1192,though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick  ,1,54,336,54,320
1193,this is high adventure at its best  ,1,7,37,7,36
1194,i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse  ,1,43,246,43,240
1195,having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt  ,1,16,73,16,72
1196,my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed  ,1,32,169,32,164
1197,almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful  ,0,14,79,14,77
1198,the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal  ,0,20,103,20,100
1199,unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain  ,0,16,102,16,98
1200,nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well  ,1,12,86,12,84
1201,the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful  ,1,12,81,12,80
1202,a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing  ,1,12,72,12,70
1203,for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job  ,1,16,85,16,82
1204,it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs  ,1,21,106,21,104
1205,its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema  ,1,16,76,16,72
1206,it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents  ,1,11,72,11,71
1207,i rather enjoyed it  ,1,4,22,4,21
1208,i liked it  ,1,3,13,3,12
1209,i couldnt take them seriously  ,0,5,33,5,31
1210,it really created a unique feeling though  ,1,7,44,7,43
1211,vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script  ,1,9,56,9,55
1212,a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today  ,1,12,63,12,61
1213,her role was played well  ,1,5,27,5,26
1214,not too screamy not to masculine but just right  ,1,9,50,9,49
1215,the camera really likes her in this movie  ,1,8,44,8,43
1216,i would have casted her in that role after ready the script  ,1,12,62,12,61
1217,as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  ,1,36,218,36,214
1218,i am a fan of his  this movie sucked really bad  ,0,12,53,11,49
1219,even worse than ticker  ,0,4,25,4,24
1220, that movie was bad  ,0,5,23,4,21
1221,only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe  poor hummh  ,0,15,77,14,73
1222,it just blew  ,0,3,15,3,14
1223,this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid  ,1,62,381,62,371
1224,i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features  ,1,34,242,34,232
1225,now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda  ,0,15,94,15,93
1226,this show is made for americans  it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere  ,0,21,111,20,109
1227,almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round  ,0,21,128,21,125
1228,i wish i could enter negative values admins  ,0,8,47,8,45
1229,the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode  ,0,15,81,15,78
1230,the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity  ,0,56,321,56,314
1231,oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too  ,0,8,46,8,44
1232,i hate writing bad reviews about films  especially those in which i really like the star  but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it  ,0,38,189,36,185
1233,i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie  ,0,31,141,31,139
1234,in short  this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film  ,0,23,115,22,113
1235,it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell  ,0,24,128,24,127
1236,110  and only because there is no setting for 010  ,0,11,55,10,51
1237,an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones  ,1,33,205,33,195
1238,the soundtrack wasnt terrible either  ,1,5,41,5,38
1239,but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable  ,0,30,211,30,199
1240,still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale  ,1,14,66,14,59
1241,yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film  it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation  ,0,36,191,35,186
1242,both do good jobs and are quite amusing  ,1,8,42,8,41
1243,but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance  ,0,20,117,20,113
1244,i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this  bad idea we both hated it  ,0,16,76,15,73
1245,the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well  ,1,12,56,12,55
1246,bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines  ,0,8,57,8,55
1247,the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie  ,0,14,82,14,80
1248,i like armand assante  my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again  ,1,21,130,20,124
1249,i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends  ,1,14,71,14,70
1250,my 810 score is mostly for the plot  ,1,8,39,8,37
1251,i wont say any more  i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time  ,1,26,118,25,111
1252,wow what a bad film  ,0,5,23,5,21
1253,not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible  ,0,8,58,8,56
1254,the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling  ,0,13,80,13,77
1255,not even good for camp value  ,0,6,31,6,30
1256,i wasnt expecting oscar material but this  ,0,7,46,7,43
1257,youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming  ,0,16,86,16,84
1258,this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public  ,0,15,81,15,77
1259,if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative  ,0,12,73,12,72
1260,this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower  ,0,12,64,12,61
1261,this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed  ,0,20,104,20,101
1262,i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script  ,0,22,112,22,110
1263,victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable  ,0,11,76,11,74
1264,considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them  ,0,24,151,24,149
1265,but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us  ,0,15,79,15,76
1266,the death row scenes were entirely unmoving  ,0,7,46,7,45
1267,the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing  ,0,10,67,10,64
1268,whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely  ,0,9,58,9,56
1269,i was deeply impressed with the character he played  ,1,9,54,9,53
1270,i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor  ,1,18,88,18,87
1271,a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  ,0,45,265,45,261
1272,even the squibs look awful  ,0,5,29,5,28
1273,at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america  ,0,12,68,12,67
1274,the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing  ,0,19,100,19,97
1275,the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  ,0,20,110,20,109
1276,i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all  ,0,15,71,15,69
1277,the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense  ,0,10,60,10,59
1278,about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words  ,0,43,259,43,255
1279,the directing is sloppy at best  ,0,6,34,6,33
1280,hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing  ,0,11,73,11,70
1281,of course the acting is blah  ,0,6,32,6,30
1282,the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting  ,0,19,113,19,112
1283,and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell  ,0,25,139,25,134
1284,i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other  ,1,34,161,34,158
1285,i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago  ,1,24,118,24,115
1286,this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before  ,1,27,140,27,136
1287,this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it  ,1,15,74,15,72
1288,overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale  ,1,12,53,12,51
1289,lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave  ,1,22,114,22,111
1290,i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning  ,0,24,148,24,146
1291,it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs  ,0,21,108,21,107
1292,totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it  ,1,24,133,24,129
1293,this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way  ,1,12,71,12,69
1294,but this movie really got to me  ,1,7,34,7,33
1295,see it  ,1,2,9,2,8
1296,i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style  ,1,26,136,26,133
1297,and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why  ,1,33,177,33,171
1298,this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006  ,1,12,60,12,59
1299,i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting  ,1,8,56,8,53
1300,initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me  ,1,15,88,15,85
1301,later i found myself lost in the power of the film  ,1,11,53,11,52
1302,the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film  ,1,10,62,10,61
1303,i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race  ,1,20,89,20,87
1304,duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance  ,1,10,64,10,63
1305,the rest of the cast also play well  ,1,8,38,8,37
1306,cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers  ,1,12,89,12,88
1307,about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts  ,0,11,68,11,67
1308,about half way through this film i started to dislike it  ,0,11,59,11,58
1309,by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it  ,0,14,68,14,65
1310,what this film lacks is a convincing script  ,0,8,46,8,45
1311,the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed  ,0,20,114,20,113
1312,things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  ,0,19,123,19,120
1313,the cast is good  ,1,4,19,4,18
1314,for that its worth checking out  ,1,6,36,6,33
1315,this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life  ,0,15,79,15,78
1316,it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen  ,0,13,74,13,73
1317,everything about it is just bad  ,0,6,34,6,33
1318,i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season  ,0,21,118,21,116
1319,the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie  ,0,24,127,23,123
1320,the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period  ,0,16,88,16,85
1321,final word this show is a real torture  ,0,8,43,8,40
1322,it is zillion times away from reality  ,0,7,40,7,39
1323,watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show  ,0,14,88,14,86

1396,the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show  ,1,21,112,21,111
1397,easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers  ,1,19,117,19,113

1422,this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat  the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more  ,1,71,479,70,466
1423,a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  ,1,47,317,47,312
1424,but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold  ,1,34,215,34,209

1545,tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering  ,1,45,252,45,247
1546,emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything  ,1,19,113,19,110
1547,despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie  ,1,9,52,9,50
1548,in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt  ,1,22,130,22,125
1549,aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene  ,1,16,101,16,97
1550,im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments  ,1,16,93,16,89
1551,i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable  ,1,11,68,11,65
1552,the football scenes at the end were perplexing  ,0,8,49,8,48
1553,but i thought his acting was skilled  ,1,7,39,7,38
1554,meredith m was better than all right  ,1,7,39,7,38
1555,a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart  ,1,9,58,9,57
1556,it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent  ,1,32,166,32,163
1557,nine out of ten for a truly lovely film  ,1,9,42,9,41
1558,this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre  ,1,17,102,17,100
1559,this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s  ,1,12,62,12,60
1560,a standout scene  ,1,3,19,3,18
1561,this scene is very strong and unpleasant  ,0,7,43,7,42
1562,technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill  ,1,35,228,34,222
1563,its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema  ,1,14,82,14,80
1564,the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end  ,1,10,59,10,58
1565,i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son  ,1,19,104,19,102
1566,this movie is also revealing  ,1,5,31,5,30
1567,personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue  ,1,21,129,21,127
1568,and it was boring  ,0,4,20,4,19
1569,i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast  ,0,19,91,19,89
1570,ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up  ,1,20,101,20,100
1571,its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect  ,1,8,50,8,46
1572,an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right  ,1,12,74,12,68
1573,all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star  ,1,34,203,34,200
1574,you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself  ,1,22,116,22,114
1575,the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating  ,1,23,132,23,129
1576,also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard  ,1,14,73,14,71
1577,you wont forget this movie  ,1,5,30,5,28
1578,why was this film made  ,0,5,25,5,24
1579,the film has an ultracheap look to it  ,0,8,41,8,39
1580,the result is a film that just dont look right  ,0,10,50,10,48
1581,none of them are engaging or exciting  ,0,7,40,7,39
1582,the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it  ,0,17,95,17,93
1583,the foreigner is not worth one second of your time  ,0,10,53,10,52
1584,i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it  ,1,20,84,20,80
1585,but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr  ,1,45,237,45,235
1586,this movie is so awesome  ,1,5,27,5,26
1587,i loved it it was really scary  ,1,7,34,7,32
1588,i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there  ,1,16,81,16,80
1589,if you want a real scare rent this one  ,1,9,41,9,40
1590,1010  ,1,1,7,1,6
1591,this is an extraordinary film  ,1,5,32,5,31
1592,as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening  ,1,16,107,16,101
1593,this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court  ,1,27,169,27,164
1594,the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen  ,1,15,92,15,89
1595,this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole  ,1,15,89,15,87
1596,predictable but not a bad watch  ,1,6,35,6,33
1597,it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part  ,1,15,72,15,71
1598,she carries the movie well  ,1,5,29,5,28
1599,constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations  ,1,18,134,18,133
1600,it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd  ,1,20,100,20,98
1601,how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong  ,0,24,150,24,140
1602,in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release  ,0,9,62,9,58
1603,avoid at all costs  ,0,4,21,4,20
1604,star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series  ,0,12,60,12,59
1605,the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  ,0,53,269,53,267
1606,the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards  ,0,51,285,51,280
1607,the only place good for this film is in the garbage  ,0,11,54,11,53
1608,the worst one of the series  ,0,6,30,6,29
1609,editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion  ,1,11,65,11,63
1610,when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions  ,1,36,199,36,194
1611,cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way  ,1,9,58,9,56
1612,of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film  ,1,15,81,15,79
1613,this film offers many delights and surprises  ,1,7,47,7,46
1614,when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film  ,1,28,183,28,179
1615,the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch  ,1,23,129,23,128
1616,you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie  but you do wish for just a small sample to savor  ,1,34,187,33,184
1617,but this understated film leaves a lasting impression  ,1,8,56,8,55
1618,the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop  ,1,11,65,11,64
1619,you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars  ,1,14,73,14,72
1620,the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch  ,1,11,59,11,55
1621,the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  ,1,38,243,38,240
1622,angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn  ,1,23,149,23,146
1623,conclusion  i loved it  ,1,5,26,4,24
1624,its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie  ,1,12,57,12,55
1625,i struggle to find anything bad to say about it  ,1,10,50,10,49
1626,mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line  ,1,34,172,34,168
1627,its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time  ,1,29,175,29,172
1628,the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism  ,1,40,245,40,240
1629,plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job  ,1,16,92,16,88
1630,juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south  ,1,31,168,31,165
1631,trumbull on i love lucy  ,1,5,27,5,25
1632,see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years  ,1,28,142,28,139
1633,see both films if you can  ,1,6,28,6,27
1634,it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead  ,1,31,174,31,169
1635,feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal  ,1,20,155,20,144
1636,very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist  ,0,12,72,12,71
1637,its very slow  ,0,3,17,3,15
1638,lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age  ,0,27,152,27,148
1639, dont waste your time  ,0,5,26,4,23
1640,end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen  ,0,14,74,14,71
1641,he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money  ,0,33,169,33,167
1642,this was one of the worst films i have ever seen  ,0,11,51,11,50
1643,im still trying to get over how bad it was  ,0,10,46,10,44
1644,this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever  ,1,13,71,13,70
1645,it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further  ,1,28,199,28,182
1646," with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough  	1
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever  	1
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle  	1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking  	0
lots of holes in the script  	0
its like a bad two hour tv movie  	0
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong  	0
the dialogue is atrocious  	0
the acting is beyond abysmal  	0
everything stinks  	0
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on  	0
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings  	0
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time  	0
in short dont bother with this movie  	0
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	1
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it  	1
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  	1
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame  	1
a film not easily forgotten  	1
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor  	1
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years  	1
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable  	1
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  	1
great movie  	1
also the story and acting were weak  	0
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt  	0
either way it sucks  	0
the script is horrendously stupid  	0
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest  	0
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid  	0
what the hell kind of crap is that  	0
then theres the plot holes  	0
you could drive a semi truck into these holes  	0
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film  	1
shes poised and amazing  	1
dee snider just plain sucks  	0
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep  	0
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing  	0
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks  	0
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably  	0
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life  	0
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid  	0
avoid at any and all costs  	0
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies  	0
avoid this film at all costs  	0
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess  	0
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict  	0
now this is a movie i really dislike  	0
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	0
the puppets look really cheesy  not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks  	0
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets  	0
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible  	0
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs  	0
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams  	1
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability  ",1,797,4487,795,4349
1647,director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next  ,1,30,182,30,178
1648,otherwise dont even waste your time on this  ,0,8,48,8,45
1649,this one just fails to create any real suspense  ,0,9,50,9,49
1650,as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening  ,0,12,81,12,78
1651,there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film  ,1,14,79,14,73

1653,one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen  ,0,10,59,10,57

1655,hated it  ,0,2,11,2,10
1656,this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad  ,0,17,85,17,84
1657,i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie  ,0,20,104,20,100
1658,i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash  ,0,10,56,10,55
1659,this is not moviemaking  ,0,4,27,4,25
1660,the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is  ,0,19,105,19,102
1661,so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen  ,0,20,96,20,92

1663,i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes  ,1,14,79,14,77
1664,excellent short film  ,1,3,23,3,22
1665,hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film  ,1,27,139,27,136
1666,i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad  ,0,9,49,9,47
1667,characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys  ,0,12,81,12,78
1668,the story line is totally predictable  ,0,6,40,6,39
1669,not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture  ,1,18,111,18,108
1670,ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  ,0,9,57,9,55
1671,bad characters bad story and bad acting  ,0,7,43,7,41
1672,really awful  ,0,2,15,2,14

1675,it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen  ,1,15,72,15,70
1676,paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years  ,1,25,157,25,156
1677,the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie  ,1,24,127,24,124
1678,i rate this movie 910  ,1,5,25,5,23
1679,i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye  ,1,38,229,38,225
1680,the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie  ,1,20,126,20,125
1681,kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord  ,1,25,146,25,142
1682,for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience  ,1,21,124,21,121
1683,it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems  ,1,13,92,13,90
1684,the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen  ,1,18,94,18,93
1685,they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with  ,1,13,64,13,62
1686,this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts  ,1,9,59,9,56
1687,the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful  ,1,11,72,11,71
1688,the story is also both funny and poignant at times  ,1,10,53,10,52
1689,people who like european films and art movies will like this movie  ,1,12,71,12,68
1690,this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it  ,1,14,65,14,62
1691,go rent it  ,1,3,13,3,12
1692,however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again  ,1,32,176,32,172
1693,its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings  ,1,25,135,25,130
1694,brilliance indeed  ,1,2,20,2,19
1695,but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you  ,1,27,170,27,164
1696,think of the film being like a dream  ,1,8,39,8,38
1697,simply beautiful  ,1,2,19,2,18
1698,both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract  ,1,25,141,25,134
